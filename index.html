<p>Still missing a bunch of features:
snappy smooth scroll.
Optimized SVG! (it's bad)
sticky catchers, so you don't get cut off columns.
All the fun art I was going to make for it.
If you have a fun Mini article/comic/anything cool.
Get in touch!</p>
<p>I sort of want to write a lot, and make the images,
    and finish all this, but I ran out of that sweet
